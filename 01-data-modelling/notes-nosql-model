When Not to Use SQL:
Need high Availability in the data: Indicates the system is always up and there is no downtime
Have Large Amounts of Data
Need Linear Scalability: The need to add more nodes to the system so performance will increase linearly
Low Latency: Shorter delay before the data is transferred once the instruction for the transfer has been received.
Need fast reads and write

CAP Theorem:
Consistency: Every read from the database gets the latest (and correct) piece of data or an error

Availability: Every request is received and a response is given -- without a guarantee that the data is the latest update

Partition Tolerance: The system continues to work regardless of losing network connectivity between nodes


Data Modeling in Apache Cassandra:
Denormalization is not just okay -- it's a must
Denormalization must be done for fast reads
Apache Cassandra has been optimized for fast writes
ALWAYS think Queries first
One table per query is a great strategy
Apache Cassandra does not allow for JOINs between tables


Primary Key
Must be unique
The PRIMARY KEY is made up of either just the PARTITION KEY or may also include additional CLUSTERING COLUMNS
A Simple PRIMARY KEY is just one column that is also the PARTITION KEY. A Composite PRIMARY KEY is made up of more than one column and will assist in creating a unique value and in your retrieval queries
The PARTITION KEY will determine the distribution of data across the system



Clustering Columns:
The clustering column will sort the data in sorted ascending order, e.g., alphabetical order. Note: this is a mistake in the video, which says descending order.
More than one clustering column can be added (or none!)
From there the clustering columns will sort in order of how they were added to the primary key
