#### OLTP VS OLAP

**Online Analytical Processing (OLAP):**
Databases optimized for these workloads allow for complex analytical and ad hoc queries, including aggregations. These type of databases are optimized for reads.

**Online Transactional Processing (OLTP):**
Databases optimized for these workloads allow for less complex queries in large volume. The types of queries for these databases are read, insert, update, and delete.

The key to remember the difference between OLAP and OLTP is analytics (A) vs transactions (T). If you want to get the price of a shoe then you are using OLTP (this has very little or no aggregations). If you want to know the total stock of shoes a particular store sold, then this requires using OLAP (since this will require aggregations).

#### NORMALIZATION

How to reach First Normal Form (1NF):

Atomic values: each cell contains unique and single values
Be able to add data without altering tables
Separate different relations into different tables
Keep relationships between tables together with foreign keys

Second Normal Form (2NF):
Have reached 1NF
All columns in the table must rely on the Primary Key

Third Normal Form (3NF):
Must be in 2nd Normal Form
No transitive dependencies
Remember, transitive dependencies you are trying to maintain is that to get from A-> C, you want to avoid going through B.

When to use 3NF:
When you want to update data, we want to be able to do in just 1 place. We want to avoid updating the table in the Customers Detail table (in the example in the lecture slide).


#### DENORMALIZATION

JOINS on the database allow for outstanding flexibility but are extremely slow. If you are dealing with heavy reads on your database, you may want to think about denormalizing your tables. You get your data into normalized form, and then you proceed with denormalization. So, denormalization comes after normalization.

#### NORMALIZATION VS DENORMALIZATION

Normalization is about trying to increase data integrity by reducing the number of copies of the data. Data that needs to be added or updated will be done in as few places as possible.

Denormalization is trying to increase performance by reducing the number of joins between tables (as joins can be slow). Data integrity will take a bit of a potential hit, as there will be more copies of the data (to reduce JOINS).
